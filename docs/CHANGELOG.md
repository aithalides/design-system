# What's New with Infor Design System

## v3.0.0

### v3.0.0 Features

- `[Tokens]` Added a new typographic scale which expands the sizes from 5 (xm, sm, md, lg, xl) to 12. This results in the token names changing from this format `$theme-size-font-{size}` to `$theme-size-font-px{size}`. ([#427](https://github.com/infor-design/design-system/issues/427))
