# What's New with Infor Design System

## v2.7.0

### v2.7.0 Features

- `[Icons]` Reversed a change in previous versions to make alert icons all have a white background as this caused issues. Concerning alert icons there are now the following `icon-[name]` - which will have transparent background, in Uplift these are linear in style, in soho these are solid in style. We also add a `icon-[name]-alert` for alert icons with a white background. If you need a white background you can use these now. ([#3052](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/3052))
- `[Tokens]` Added a new typographic scale which expands the sizes from 5 (xm, sm, md, lg, xl) to 12. This results in the token names changing from this format `$theme-size-font-{size}` to `$theme-size-font-px{size}`, the old tokens are kept for now for backwards compatibility but may later be removed `$theme-size-font-px{size}` tokens should be used. ([#427](https://github.com/infor-design/design-system/issues/427))
